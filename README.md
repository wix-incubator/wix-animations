# Wix Animations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix/wix-animations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix/wix-animations)

Wix Animations contains the `Animator` React Component. 

This component will animate any child it has that will mount or unmount.

The `Animator` component uses [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) library. It is compliant with Wix UX style guidelines for animations.
